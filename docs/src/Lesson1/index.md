# Getting started

This file contains instructions for completing today's lesson.
It is written in a language called "markdown",
which allows plain text to be easily converted
into nicely formatted webpages like the one you're looking at now.
But we'll come back to this.

To complete this lesson, follow the instructions below.

!!! warning
    It is even more important than usual
    to read and follow instructions
    when it comes to computers and programming.
    We will be interacting with our computers
    using procedural language - that is,
    language that follows a strict set of procedures.
    Skipping steps or doing things out of order
    can lead to unexpected results.
